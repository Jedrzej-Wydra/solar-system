## History
I took on this project when I decided it was time to learn Python. I figured, why not challenge a bit of conventional wisdom? After all, it’s not just that Copernicus was right and all the planets orbit the Sun in ellipses — it’s only true when the Sun is your point of reference. But what if we chose a different planet as the reference point? Without worrying too much about scale, I set out to create an animation that shows the paths various celestial bodies would take if you changed the reference point. One scenario even closely resembles Copernicus’s heliocentric model, just for the sake of a fun comparison.
